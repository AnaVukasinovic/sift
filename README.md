SIFT
====

Satellite Information Familiarization Tool (SIFT) was designed by the SSEC to
support scientists during forecaster training events. It provides a graphical
interface for visualization and basic analysis of geostationary satellite data.

The Project Wiki and Git repository can be accessed at
https://gitlab.ssec.wisc.edu/rayg/CSPOV/wikis/home.

SIFT is built on open source technologies like Python, OpenGL, and PyQt4. It
can be run from Mac, Windows, and Linux.

Data Access
-----------

Currently SIFT requires input data to be preprocessed. In the future this
process will be included internally in the SIFT GUI. For now input data files
are preprocessed by the development team at the SSEC. Please contact
Jordan Gerth, Ray Garcia, or David Hoese to get access to this early release
data set.

Run from Windows
----------------

When installed via the `setup.exe` installer, SIFT can be run from the "SIFT"
shortcut in the start menu. By default SIFT stores temporary and cache files
in a "Workspace" located at the user's "Documents/sift_workspace".

Installing and Running from Linux or Mac
----------------------------------------

Currently running SIFT on Linux or Mac can be accomplished by installing the
python software in an Anaconda environment on those platforms. For more
details see the Wiki.
